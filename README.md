1.Create a new java package with a class TicTacToe.
2.Print out a game board with 3 rows and 3 columns (by using a 2 dimensional array). 
3.Create a method that will place the x or the o (depending on which player is doing the input) in the position that each of the users will have chosen. The placement of x or o will continue until all the spaces will be filled in.
4.Define 2 users : “player1”, ‘player2’ and assign characters to them - o for one, x for the other
5.Using the scanner, we will receive input from both users (in squares 1 - 9)
6.Create a method to check the winner ( creating all the winning positions)
7.Create array lists for each player to check their placement of symbols
8.Create a method to congratulate whoever has won or to print out a message "It's a tie"if it is a tie.
9.Make sure, that it is not possible to make any changes in the squares, that are already taken.
